              <h4>Quiet Man statue and cottage</h4>
              <p>Situated on the border of Galway close to Connemara. Cong is a small village most notoriously known for being the filming destination for the film, The Quiet Man, featuring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.</p>

              <p>Circular Rd, Cong North, Cong, Co. Mayo, Ireland</p>
              <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
              <p>Cong is such a small and quaint little village, although it attracts a lot of visitors during peak periods it is usually quite peaceful and they have beautiful nature walks to explore. As a history lover I also enjoyed walking through the ruins of Cong Abbey and observing what remains of such amazing architecture. </p>

              <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
              <p>I originally visited Clare Island with my family to learn more about our ancestory, the people were so friendly and helpful. There was a lot to learn about the history of the island and they even have a small musuem which offers further guidance and information. The food was spectacular, so fresh and yummy! It is also a great chnace to get your camera out and capture some of the awe-inspiring views the island has to offer.</p>

              <h4>National Museum of Ireland-Country Life</h4>
              <p>The National Museum of Ireland-Country Life was the first branch to be established outside of Dublin in 2001. It has since hosted up to 1.1 million people from all around the world.It features two very different buildings, the first is a High Victorian Gothic style built in 1865 and the other is a modern stone-clad block building designed by the Office of Official Works. The museum explores the lives of rural people between 1850 - 1950.  </p>

              <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
              <p>I have always loved visiting museums wherever I go. This one was particularly interesting as it gave me insight into my family's past. The contrast between the old and the new architecture was interesting and the gardens/galss greenhouse were very eye-catching.</p>
